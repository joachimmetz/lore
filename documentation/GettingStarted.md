## Before you start coding

### Selecting a project name

Naming conflicts

Trademarks

### Selecting a versioning scheme

You version control system (VCS), such as git, has built in versioning

What else needs a version?

Practical tips:
* MSI version
* Linux shared library (.so) versioning and deb and rpm package names
